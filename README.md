So, this project was not very well made, I am very new to programming and I wanted to share my work hoping someone could help me figure it out.
There are many files but they are all revisions, the main ones are:
index.js
module.js
node_helper.js

authorize.js was supposed to be used but index.js is from google and I think that is a better way to do it, i got further using index.js, But you can try either
the rest of the files are old revisions and little bits that were changed througout development, but if they help you develop it more, than thats great, so i left them there

this module is made for MagicMirror.
I am developing this on a windows pc, but I am hoping it will work on linux as well, or whatever you are running magicmirror on

the intention of this is you can display your tasks from a google tasks list and you can check them off by clicking or tapping them, I made this for a touchcreen
all in one pc that I am setting up in my kitchen as a home dashboard, but we need to be able to check off tasks, and unfortunately the microsoft to do one requires some developer stuff that i dont have access to.
this left me with google tasks, and I was hoping to make it work but I was unsuccessful. If you take a look and fix the issue feel free to send it over to me so I can update my program, I will be sure to reference you if you are able to make it work better
good luck everyone!
